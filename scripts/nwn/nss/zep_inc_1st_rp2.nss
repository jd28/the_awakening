//Allows a delayed execution of a script on an object using
//"Game Time" as opposed to realtime (which you should just use DelayCommand(float, ExecuteScript...)

//  This function checks the time remaining and runs itself again as follows:
//  Under 5  Game Minutes     -> Every 12 Real Seconds
//  Under 1  Game Hours       -> Every 30 Real Seconds
//  Under 6  Game Hours       -> Every Real Minute.
//  Less than 1 Day           -> Every 5.0 Real Minutes
//  Greater than 1 Day        -> Every 12 Real Minutes.
//  Greater than 1 Month      -> Every 30 Real Minutes.
//
// IMPORTANT NOTE: You can run multiple delays of the same script on the same object
//                 ONLY IF it has a different delay time specified in seconds (regardless of the start time of the script).
//                 Good Example: X1st_GameTimeDelayScript("same", GetFirstPC(), 0, 5, 0, 0);  and X1st_GameTimeDelayScript("same", GetFirstPC(), 0, 5, 0, 1);

//                            Bad b/c 1 hour = 60 minutes, hence it's the same time in seconds.
//
//      The reason for this is that this function creates a Count-down Identifier based
//          on the script name and the # of total time (in seconds) when it is first called.
//          Thus in the Good Example the variable names will be based upon "same18000" for the first call and
//          "same18001" for the second call. For the bad example both will led to "same3600".
//
// Variable names must be kept to 32 characters. The ones generated in this script use the following syntax:
// @@<script_name><sec>  where @@ are two character headers.
// Since 1 year in seconds leads to 8 character places, this leaves script names up to 22 characters
// that can be used for objects. Since scripts can only be 16 characters, we're safe :) Heck I might just go crazy and add another character to the header - you watch me now!

  An nPCReaction value of 1 means the horse will not respond. This value is saved for any cruelty the PC inflicts on it and it is not used as an initial reaction
  Likewise a value of 10 means the horse truly loves the PC, which is also reserved for acts of kindness.

  Un valore di 1 significa che il cavallo non risponderà. Questo valore è conservato per tutta
  la crudeltà che il pc infligge su esso e non è usato come reazione iniziale. Inoltre un valore di 10 mezzi
  il cavallo allineare ama il pc, che inoltre è riservato agli atti di bontà.
